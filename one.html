       the primary about people, come together and using technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect network hardware, software, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access by hackers.
       Technology is becoming more and more important to and integrated in our lives resulting in us become increasingly addicted to it its going to make life easier, but it also leaves us susceptible to risk thanks to this cyber security is top priority and affects our daily/working lives greatly
       Password security
       In today’s world, we are inundated with software and platforms that require password: social media accounts bank account computer phones pins ETC. The increase of having too many passwords is difficult as it is a hassle to remember them all, but it is a line of protection from cybercriminals 
       </p>
   <p>within their governments in which hacking is a prescribed function. Some
       military and civilian security and law enforcement agencies feature divisions
       whose mandate is to hack the sensitive systems of foreign adversaries. It is a
       point of contention when some of these agencies intrude into the private files
       and communications of their own citizens, often leading to political
       consequences.
       </p>
       <p>Penalties for illegal hacking largely depend on the nature of the
           transgression itself. Accessing someone’s private information without their
           authorization would likely carry a lesser penalty than using the access to steal
           money, sabotage equipment, or to commit treason. High-profile prosecutions
           have resulted from hackers stealing and either selling or disseminating
           personal, sensitive, or classified information.</p>
           <P>All computers rely on software (or “firmware”, in some devices) to
               translate input or user commands into action. Software manages user logins,
               performs database queries, executes website form submissions, controls
               hardware and peripherals, and manages other aspects of computer and
               network functionality that could be exploited by a hacker. Aside from the fact
               that programmers make mistakes and oversights, it is impossible for software
               developers to anticipate every feasible vulnerability in their code. The most
               developers can hope for is to patch and amend their software</P>
